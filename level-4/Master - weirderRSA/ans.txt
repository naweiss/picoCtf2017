The first thing we have to notice is that e and dp are modular inverses of each other mod (p - 1). Because of this, if we take any number a, a^(e * dp) ≡ a mod p. This cracks the entire problem for us, since if we subtract from both sides, we're left with a^(e * dp) - a ≡ 0 mod p, making a^(e * dp) - a a multiple of p. Now, if we take the GCD of N and a^(e * dp) - a, we're at a very small likelyhood of getting anything other than p. Then, if we just divide by p, we get q, and we can calculate d and decrypt the message~
