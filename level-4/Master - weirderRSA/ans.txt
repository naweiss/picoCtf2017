The first thing we have to notice is that e and dp are modular inverses of - each other mod (p - 1).
Because of this, if we take any number a, a^(e * dp) ≡ a mod p.

This cracks the entire problem for us, since if we subtract 'a' from both sides.
We're left with a^(e * dp) - a ≡ 0 mod p.
Making a^(e * dp) - a a multiple of p.

Now, if we take the GCD of N and a^(e * dp) - a, we're at a very small likelihood of getting anything other than p.
Then, if we just divide by p, we get q, and we can calculate d and decrypt the message
