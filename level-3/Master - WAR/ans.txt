# The mistake was to add \x00 at count+1 instead of count.
# So if full-length name (32-byte) was given the next byte (desk size)
#	will be replaced with 0.
# This will let us play more cards the the actual deck size (won't trigger the check)
#	and we will start playing cards from the name field or from the opponent card if the name
#	cannot be casted to a valid card.
# After we start winning we will bet on more then single dollar
